"""The grounding walker: it REJECTS an ungrounded response envelope.

Grounding is a money-correctness-adjacent containment invariant. This module
walks a :class:`~llm.envelope.contract.ResponseEnvelope` and collects every
violation of the §12.2 response contract, then :func:`validate_grounding` raises
:class:`GroundingError` if any exist. The rules, each traceable to a PRD ID:

* **CHAT-002** — every numeric financial value must be *copied* from a typed
  service response: a numeric :class:`SourcedValue` with an empty source
  reference is a fabricated number and is rejected. The model-text slot
  (``model_inference``) may contain NO digits at all — the model can never
  introduce a financial number.
* **CHAT-005** — every operational claim carries evidence refs with a capture
  time and a quality state; a claim without well-formed evidence is rejected
  (the caller then fails closed to :class:`~llm.envelope.contract.CannotAnswer`).
* **CHAT-012** — a known exposure total must come from the margin engine; any
  other provenance is rejected. (An unknown total is structurally allowed and
  renders as unknown.)
* **CHAT-021** — a comparison carries both values, the delta, and both
  timestamps; a missing side/delta/timestamp is rejected.
* **CHAT-022** — every named state uses a canonical catalog key; an invented
  synonym is rejected (the key set is verified against the packages/locale
  catalog by a drift test).
* **CHAT-023** — an inline table is capped at 20 rows; beyond that it must
  summarize and deep-link.

The validator never mutates and never "repairs" — it fails closed.
