"""The grounding walker: it REJECTS an ungrounded response envelope.

Grounding is a money-correctness-adjacent containment invariant. This module
walks a :class:`~llm.envelope.contract.ResponseEnvelope` and collects every
violation of the §12.2 response contract, then :func:`validate_grounding` raises
:class:`GroundingError` if any exist. The rules, each traceable to a PRD ID:

* **CHAT-002** — every numeric financial value must be *copied* from a typed
  service response: a numeric :class:`SourcedValue` with an empty source
  reference is a fabricated number and is rejected. The model-text slot
  (``model_inference``) may contain NO digits at all — the model can never
  introduce a financial number.
* **CHAT-005** — every operational claim carries evidence refs with a capture
  time and a quality state; a claim without well-formed evidence is rejected
  (the caller then fails closed to :class:`~llm.envelope.contract.CannotAnswer`).
* **CHAT-012** — a known exposure total must come from the margin engine; any
  other provenance is rejected. (An unknown total is structurally allowed and
  renders as unknown.)
* **CHAT-021** — a comparison carries both values, the delta, and both
  timestamps; a missing side/delta/timestamp is rejected.
* **CHAT-022** — every named state uses a canonical catalog key; an invented
  synonym is rejected (the key set is verified against the packages/locale
  catalog by a drift test).
* **CHAT-023** — an inline table is capped at 20 rows; beyond that it must
  summarize and deep-link.
* **Issue #54 (section-evidence policy)** — schema-valid provenance is not enough:
  each §12.2 category section must satisfy its *semantics* declared in the
  deterministic :data:`SECTION_POLICY` matrix — a minimum evidence-backed source
  count (``INSUFFICIENT_SOURCES``), the evidence category its values may carry
  (``WRONG_EVIDENCE_CATEGORY``), and, for current-state sections, at least one
  current (non-stale) source unless staleness is disclosed
  (``STALE_TEMPORAL_EVIDENCE``). These apply to every PRESENT section regardless of
  the #51 catalog; an empty section carries no requirement.

The validator never mutates and never "repairs" — it fails closed.

# --- issue #54: the deterministic section-evidence policy matrix -------------
#
# Schema-valid provenance is not enough (issue #54): each response SECTION must
# also satisfy its *semantics* — a minimum number of evidence-backed sources, the
# evidence category its values may carry, and (for current-state sections) at
# least one CURRENT source. These three rules are declared ONCE, as data, in
# :data:`SECTION_POLICY`, so section semantics read from a single table rather
# than scattered conditionals (DRY/KISS). The walker below enforces the table.
#
# FRESHNESS DEFINITION (deterministic, no clock, no inference): staleness is read
# from the canonical evidence QUALITY label, never from wall-clock arithmetic. An
# evidence ref is *stale* iff its ``quality`` is one of :data:`STALE_QUALITY_KEYS`
# (``freshness.stale`` / ``state.stale`` — the only canonical labels that denote a
# reading past its freshness window; note ``state.expired`` is a state_key value,
# not an admissible evidence quality). An evidence ref is *current* iff it is
# well-formed and its quality is NOT stale (``freshness.fresh``, ``freshness.aging``,
# ``state.verified``, ``state.supported`` … all read as current). A temporal
# claim is rejected (``STALE_TEMPORAL_EVIDENCE``) when it carries evidence, every
# well-formed ref is stale, and it is NOT honestly disclosing staleness via a
# stale state_key (:data:`STALE_DISCLOSURE_STATE_KEYS`). Disclosing staleness is a
# grounded report, not a false current claim, so it stays legal — this is exactly
# how the data-quality suite surfaces a stale reading AS stale.
